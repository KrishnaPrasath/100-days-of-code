**It has been a long period of gap in my learning curve. Quit my job and joined as an intern at GUVI by July 15,2019. Lot has happened. Hoping to achieve a lot.

**Today's Progress**: Watched cs 50 intro and 2 more videos - learned fundamentals of how computer works based on I/P received | Completed GUVI course - WEB DEVELOPMENT | Working on soring arrays (realized that there is lot more to cover)

**Task pending : Posting a blog about BootStrap | Buldinng a layout for a website

**Thoughts**: Routine is the key | Follow the 5 second rule

**Things I learned : When I tried to sort an array, I kept getting the sorted arrays in a reverse order. Then after 2-3 hours of brainstorming, I figured that I had to start runnning the inner loop from where I start from outerloop on each iteration.
